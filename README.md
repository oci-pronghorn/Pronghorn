=====

Staged event driven single machine embedded micro-framework.

* Garbage Free (core runtime)
* Lock Free
* Block Free
* Small memory footprint
* Smart thread scheduling


Garbage free message passing design eliminates garbage collector stalls providing predictable data rates.  
Lock free non-blocking message passing enables cores to make continuous progress at all times.  
Staged pipeline scheduler enables optimization of the workload across cores.

#Why Pronghorn

1. Broad compatibility   
	  Android (Java 7 subset) no Lambdas used  
	  Java profile compact1  
	  No use of Unsafe, Java 9 module compatibility       
2. Simple concurrency model  
	  quickly write correct code with actors  
	  easily leverage hundreds or more cores  
	  all pipes are defined as produced from one actor and consumed by one other       
3. Separation of design concerns    
		* Business aware scheduling	 
		   Actors who do not have work are not scheduled  
		   Schedulers can be custom designed or existing solutions applied   
		* Strong types generated externally  
	       Types between actors are externally defined  
	       New fields can be added and mapped to new business specific usages  
4. Multiple APIs  
	   Embedded friendly use of wrapping arrays  
	   Integrate with a wide variety of existing interfaces  
	   Visitors for reading and writing  
	   Object proxies for reading and writing  
	   Zero copy direct access to input and output fields  
	   Replay of messages until they are released  
5. Simple debug and refactoring   
	   Messages have full provenance and actor chain upon exception   
	   Test framework supports automated regression test construction for refactor   
	   Fuzz testing based on message pipes definitions   
	   Generative contract testing based on behavior definitions for stages   
6. Static memory allocations  
	   No need to release memory and no GC  
	   Simplify memory usage analysis of the application   
	   Minimize runtime failures, including out of memory  
7. Copy preferred over lock usage  
		No stalled cores, block free, wait free, continuous progress  
		Efficient power usage  
		Leverages new fast memory subsystems  
		Enables efficient NUMA usage  
8. Sequential memory usage  
		Leverages CPU pre-fetch and caches for fastest possible throughput  
		Persistence and immediate start up for free with non-volatile memory  
		All media is sequential, mechanical sympathy  
		Maximum use of hardware bandwidth  
9. Software sketches  
	Extensive requirements gathering put into a graph  
	Involve non-technical people in the early stages  
	Refine the design before making any commitments, or beginning iterations   
10. Minimized deployed application   
	For embedded systems, only the needed applications and interfaces are deployed   
	Configuration is done at compile time   
	Ultra-small attack surface   
	Scales well in docker and cloud deployments   
	Targests absolute minimum resources consumed   

#Expected usage plan

Most projects using this framework will follow these steps.

1. Define your data flow graph.
2. Define the contracts between each stage.
3. Test first development by using generative testing as the graph is implemented.

NOTE: this is being proved out in the PronghornGateway project.
